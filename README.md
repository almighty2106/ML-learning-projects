Soccer Ball Juggling Agent Using Unity

Here's my final AI project using Unity, it's a soccer ball juggling simulator agent. The ML tools I used is ml-agents from:

https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents

Project files are in "master" branch !!!!

Trainning results are in "assets/config".

The trainning model is in "assets/config/results".

Train Scene is "assets/Training scene.unity".

To start the game. open up the the file "New Scene.unity" using Unity.
Drag the model that you want into "Behavior Parameters/model" component at the right side.
You can do this in the prefab page in this case all the agents will be replaced with this model

Click start button to start the scene.

There's only one scripts which located in "assets/scriipts" named "agent.cs" 
"agent.yaml" contains basic parameters related to training.



Thank you!
