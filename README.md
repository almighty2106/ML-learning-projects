Soccer Ball Juggling Agent Using Unity

Here's my final AI project using Unity, it's a soccer ball juggling simulator agent. The ML tools I used is ml-agents from:

https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents

Project files are in "master" branch

Trainning results are in "conig"

The trainning model is in config/results

To start the game. open up the the file "New Scence.unity" using Unity
Train Scene is "Training scece.unity"

There's only one scripts which located in "assets/scriipts" named "agent.cs" 
"agent.yaml" contains basic parameters related to training



Thank you!
